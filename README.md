### User Story

## We have created a hotel web app which allow users to register as host or guest or both in this web app in 8 working days.

# A host can add new house to listing so that everyone can book this property for short period.

# A host can delete the booking /cancel for the guest

# A host will only see all bookings accociated with her/his own properties

# A guest can review all houses and book any house if it is applicable

# A guest can make review for past booking

# All users have their dashboard where you can see your houses or bookings

### How to install

# replace "https://hotelable.herokuapp.com" to "http://localhost:3000" first in the vscode

# run npm i then npm run dev
